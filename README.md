# learning-flask

Just one of the things I'm learning. https://github.com/hchiam/learning

```
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate # to use the virtual environment
pip install Flask
export FLASK_APP=hi.py
flask run
http://localhost:5000
deactivate # to close the virtual environment
```

And then after that, every time you want to run the site:
```
. venv/bin/activate
flask run
http://localhost:5000
```

Remember to close the venv when you're done:
```
deactivate
```
